## Challenge 02

Modify the existing `app.R` to do everything that the app from Challenge 01 did but using a new data set and

1. Compute and display assignment-type averages
2. Compute and display overall course grade with PS being 30% and Labs being 70%.

Use the slightly less simple data set found at `data/gs.csv`.
